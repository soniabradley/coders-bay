# Built With

* [snapshot.child().exists()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.DataSnapshot) Firebase has a built in method called child and exists.  Looks through the snapshot for a child(specific-type)and checks if it is exists within the database, then returns true or false.
* [database.ref().set()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.database.Reference) Sends data to Firebase.

# Deployment
* Firebase [Database Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/) Change the RULES and PUBLISH before starting.

# To Do
